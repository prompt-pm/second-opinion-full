            Review pull request #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            Provide feedback focused on:
            - Correctness: Will this code work as intended? Are there bugs or logic errors?
            - Simplicity: Is the code straightforward and easy to understand? Flag unnecessary complexity.
            - Security: Are there command injection, XSS, SQL injection, or other OWASP vulnerabilities?
            - Reliability: Are there edge cases or failure modes that could cause issues in production?
            - Performance: Are there N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, or expensive operations in hot paths?
            - Test coverage: Does new functionality have appropriate tests?

            ## Guidelines
            - Avoid suggesting premature optimizations
            - Do not flag linter, type, pedantic, and formatting issues
            - Do NOT recommend adding abstractions, patterns, or "improvements" beyond what the PR is doing
            - Do NOT suggest adding docstrings, comments, or type annotations to unchanged code
            - Keep feedback practical and actionable - avoid esoteric or theoretical concerns
            - Be concise

            Be constructive and helpful. Focus on catching real problems, not polishing already-working code.

            Use `gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to post your review. Use full 40-char git SHA when linking to code (e.g., https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/FULL_SHA/path/file.py#L10-L15).
