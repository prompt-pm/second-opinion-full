Second opinion helps overthinkers make choices. It gives users more options, sharpens their criteria, and helps them decide faster by using decision making theory.
1. ❓ ~Ask the right question~ — which question if answered first would answer every other question?
2. 🔀 ~Widen your options~ with suggested alternatives

### Quotes
*Change my frame from “I can’t believe this happened to me” to “This happened but I knew it was a possibility”*

*Stop sabotaging my quest to do big things.*

*every decision i've ever made that wasn't an instant "hell yes" has been a mistake. every pro/con list is an admission the thing isn't worth it.*

*the path God has laid out for you is so obvious it feels like getting bludgeoned with an anvil. no analysis makes a bad decision good*

*If you can’t decide, the answer is no. If two equally difficult paths, choose the one more painful in the short term (pain avoidance is creating an illusion of equality). Choose the path that leaves you more composed in the long term.*
